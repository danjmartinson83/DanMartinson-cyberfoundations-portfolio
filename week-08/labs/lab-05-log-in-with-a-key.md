# Week 8 Lab 05 — Log In with a Key

**Student Name:**  
**Date Completed:**  
**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-05-log-in-with-a-key.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Authorize the public key created in Lab 03 and prove that `analyst@localhost` authenticates with that key without falling back to the account password.

## What You Already Know

In Week 6, SSH used the `analyst` account password. Here, the server stores the public key in `authorized_keys`, while the private key stays in the client account. The same user, protocol, and destination remain; only the authentication method changes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**Required prerequisite:** Complete Lab 03 first.

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Lab 03 key pair exists" ||   echo "STOP: complete Lab 03 before continuing"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Does the private key need to be copied into `authorized_keys`? Explain.

```text
(write 2–3 sentences here)
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare `authorized_keys`

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### Step 2 — Add the Week 8 Public Key Once

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
grep -qxF "$(cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub)" ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   || cat ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

This command adds the key only if an identical line is not already present.

### Step 3 — Confirm the Entry and Safe Permissions

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

**Required result:** The count is `1`; permissions show `700` for `.ssh` and `600` for `authorized_keys`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab05-authorized-key-permissions.png`.

### Step 4 — Run the Public-Key-Only Proof

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ssh   -o PreferredAuthentications=publickey   -o PasswordAuthentication=no   -i ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   analyst@localhost   'echo "AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS"; whoami; hostname'
```

If SSH asks whether to trust the host fingerprint, type `yes` and press Enter. If no fingerprint question appears, continue; `localhost` was already known. Do not delete `known_hosts` to force the question.

At `Enter passphrase for key`, enter the **Lab 03 key passphrase**. Do not enter the `analyst` account password.

**Required result:**

```text
AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS
analyst
cf-student-XX
```

The final hostname will contain your assigned VM number instead of `XX`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the three result lines as `week08-lab05-publickey-auth-success.png`.

## Stop & Check

If the command asks for the `analyst` account password, reports `Permission denied`, or does not print `AUTH_TEST=PUBLICKEY_SUCCESS`, do not submit. The options in the proof command disable account-password fallback for this one test only; they do not change the VM server.

### Troubleshooting

1. Run `grep -c 'week8-analyst-key$' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required value is `1`.
2. Run `stat -c '%a %n' ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`; required values are `700` and `600`.
3. Run `ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub`; it must show the Lab 03 key.
4. If any check fails, stop and contact the instructor. Do not edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, use `sudo`, disable password authentication, or delete `known_hosts`.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, compare Week 6 password authentication with this key-based test. State what changed and what stayed the same.

```

## Analysis Questions

1. What changed between the Week 6 and Week 8 SSH logins?
2. What stayed the same?
3. Why does `authorized_keys` contain the public key rather than the private key?
4. Why is the forced proof stronger evidence than a normal successful SSH login?
5. How is the key passphrase different from the `analyst` account password?

## GitHub / Lab Portal Submission

1. In the Lab Portal, open the matching Week 8 lab.
2. Complete every **[WORKSHEET]** response.
3. Upload only the required screenshots to `assets/screenshots/week-08/`.
4. Select **Submit to GitHub**.
5. Open the committed worksheet and screenshots on GitHub. Confirm they are readable and contain no secrets.

**Never submit:** `.pem` files, files from `~/.ssh/`, passwords, passphrases, private-key contents, or a Bastion shareable URL.
