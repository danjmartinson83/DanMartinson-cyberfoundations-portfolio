## Overview

Lessons 3 and 4 taught you what a virtual machine is and how one lives and dies. This capstone lab hands you the keys: in the VM Builder Simulator you'll provision a machine of your own through the full five-question wizard (Part A), handle whatever provisioning throws at you (Part B), and run the complete lifecycle — stop, start, snapshot, delete — while a billing meter runs (Part C). This lab is the heart of **★ Deliverable 1: VM concepts + CLI screenshots** — its two screenshots join the two from Labs 01 and 02 in your portfolio repo.

**The simulator will push back on purpose.** Taken names, refused passwords, quota limits, and a region that sometimes fails are all part of the exercise — reading an error calmly and fixing the right thing *is* the skill being graded. Errors here are progress, not mistakes.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations VM Builder Simulator — runs entirely in your web browser; nothing to install, no account needed, no real servers, no real money |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 3 and 4 completed; Labs 01 and 02 recommended first |
| Concept Checks | The simulator gates progress on four Concept Checks — all four are covered in Lessons 3 and 4 |
| Time | Plan for 30–45 minutes, including this worksheet |

### How to Open the Simulator — Step by Step

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari all work — use a computer, not a phone, so your screenshots capture the full screen).
2. Go to this address (you can also click the **VM Builder Simulator** link on the Lab Portal's Week 4 page — same destination):

```
https://cybervisionariesinstitute.github.io/cyberfoundations-simulators/vm-builder.html
```

3. Confirm you're in the right place: you should see a dark purple header reading **"Foundry District Cloud Annex"** and a page titled **"Mission Briefing: Provision Your First Virtual Machine."** If you see anything else, re-check the address.
4. Read the Mission Briefing all the way down — especially the **"How to use this simulator"** box. It explains the six steps, the Concept Checks, and the two screenshot moments.
5. Get your screenshot tool ready before you begin: **Windows:** press `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** press `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You will need it twice, at moments the simulator announces with a 📸 banner.
6. Keep this worksheet open in a **second browser tab**, side by side with the simulator — you'll record answers as you go.

**⚠️ One thing to know before you start:** refreshing the simulator page **resets the entire simulation** — nothing is saved between visits. That's safe (it's a training environment), but capture each screenshot when prompted, before moving on, and don't refresh mid-run unless you want a fresh start.

**Also before you start:** have Lesson 4's Resource Pack open to its Quick Reference page (the lifecycle/billing table). You'll want it.

## Part A — Provision Your Machine

### Step 1 — Name It Like a Professional

Work through the Basics screen: choose a VM name that passes the naming rules *and* would tell a stranger what this machine is for. Note: at least one obvious name is already taken — if you hit **NameNotAvailable**, that's the simulator doing its job; pick another and record what happened.

The name you chose, and whether you hit the taken-name error first:

```
djm
```

### Step 2 — Choose a Region, and Say Why

Pick a region on the Basics screen. Each option describes a trade-off (latency, capacity). Record your choice and one sentence of reasoning — professionals never pick a region at random.

Your region and your reasoning:

```
I choose Foundry Central because it's closest to me, and my commands reach the VM faster.
```

### Step 3 — Choose Your Guest OS

Pick an operating system and record why. There's no wrong answer, but there is a *reasoned* answer — think about which shell you'd rather manage it with, and what the license fee note tells you.

Your OS choice and reasoning:

```
I chose Linux because I am more comfortable with its command lines.  There is no license fee.
```

### Step 4 — Size It, and Do the Money Math

Pick a size tier. Record its specs and hourly rate, then do Lesson 4's monthly reflex: hourly rate × 24 × 30. Would you leave this machine running for a month?

Your size tier, its specs, and its hourly rate:

```
D2s_v3 $0.110/Hr x24=$2.64 a day x 30 days= $79.20 a month.
2 vCPUs . 8GB RAM . 128GB disk
```

Your monthly math (rate × 24 × 30):

```
D2s_v3 $0.110/Hr x24=$2.64 a day x 30 days= $79.20 a month.
```

### Step 5 — Create the Admin Account

Create the administrator username and password. The simulator blocks guessable usernames and refuses weak passwords — if it pushes back, record what it rejected and what you learned from the rejection.

What (if anything) got rejected, and your final username (never record the password):

```
Nothing
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED — Deliverable 1)

On the Review & Create screen — before you click Create — take the screenshot the simulator prompts for: your full configuration summary, including the total hourly cost. Name it exactly **`vm-config-summary.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part B — Survive Provisioning

### Step 1 — Create, and Read What Happens

Click **Create Virtual Machine** and watch the provisioning stages. Depending on your Part A choices, provisioning may fail with a readable error — **QuotaExceeded** (your size is bigger than the subscription allows) or **AllocationFailed** (your region ran out of capacity). If it fails: read the error, identify which wizard choice it points at, fix *that one thing*, and retry.

What happened on your first Create attempt (success, or the exact error name):

```
success
```

If you hit an error: what it told you, and what you changed:

```
n/a
```

### Step 2 — Confirm You're Running

Once provisioning completes, confirm on the dashboard: status **Running**, and the billing meter ticking at the rate your size card promised. Record the rate the meter shows.

The running rate shown on your dashboard:

```
$0.110/hr
```

---

## Part C — Run the Full Lifecycle

Complete all four lifecycle tasks on the dashboard, in this order, and answer the simulator's Concept Checks as they appear.

### Step 1 — Stop, and Watch the Meter

Stop (deallocate) your VM. Watch what happens to the billing rate — it should not go to zero. Record the stopped rate and what it's paying for.

The stopped rate, and what a stopped VM still pays for:

```
storage fee $0.002/hr disk only
```

### Step 2 — Start It Again

Start the VM and confirm the full rate resumes. One sentence: where did your files go while it was stopped?

Your one-sentence answer:

```
disc only
```

### Step 3 — Take a Snapshot

Take a snapshot and record its name from the snapshot list. One sentence: what exactly did you just photograph, and when would you be glad you have it?

Snapshot name and your one-sentence explanation:

```
when proving that you stopped it and when you stopped it the simulated hours are like a odometer on a car.
```

### Step 4 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED — Deliverable 1)

With your VM **Running** and at least one snapshot visible, take the dashboard screenshot. Name it exactly **`vm-dashboard-running.png`**.

### Step 5 — Delete, and Read the Warning

Delete your VM. Read the confirmation dialog before you click — record what it warns you is about to happen, then confirm and record your final total cost from the completion banner.

What the delete warning said, in your own words:

```
Deleting a VM permanently destroys its virtual disk and everything on it. In a real cloud platform, there is no undo — this is why administrators take snapshots first. Your snapshot means you could rebuild. Deleting is also the only way to stop all billing. Proceed?
```

Your final simulated cost:

```
$30.09
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Your stopped VM kept billing a small amount. Explain the "locker fee" in your own words — what physical thing still exists when a VM is stopped, and why is deletion the only true zero? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The disk and data on the vm.  The disk is destroyed after you delete it. No more "locker fee".
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Lesson 4 revealed that your real Weeks 6–12 lab machines are stamped from golden snapshots your instructor built. Using what you did in Part C, Step 3, explain how a golden snapshot works and why it means every student's machine starts identical. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A snapshot is a perfect frozen copy of a vm's disk at one moment.  Photograph before you gamble.
A golden snapshot is when the master craftsman builds one perfect workshop, photographs it, and files the photograph in a vault. From then on, nobody builds by hand. If I needed a copy of a workshop or even 40 I could use the golden snapshot to stamp them in minutes.  This is how IT departments hand out identical laptops, and how cloud teams spin up matching server fleets at scale. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** If you hit a provisioning error in Part B (or even if you didn't): why do you think this lab *wants* you to encounter errors in a simulator before Week 6 hands you real infrastructure? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
It's better to hit the issues now rather than when I am inside real infrastructure.  Make the mistakes in the beginning inside a safe zone. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Defend your Part A size choice to an imaginary manager watching the budget: why was your tier the right rent for this job, and what would have made you pick a bigger or smaller one? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
I needed a medium-sized one because I am not constantly running apps or leaving the meter running.
For me, it got the job done without going overboard.   
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection — ★ Deliverable 1

This lab completes **Deliverable 1: VM concepts + CLI screenshots**. Two things get committed:

**1. This worksheet, via the Lab Portal:**

1. Go to the CyberFoundations Lab Portal and sign in.
2. Open **Week 4 → Lab 03: Build Your First Virtual Machine**.
3. Fill in the worksheet fields and click **Submit to GitHub**. The Portal commits the completed file to `week-04/labs/lab-03-vm-builder.md`.

**2. Your four Deliverable 1 screenshots, uploaded to `assets/screenshots/week-04/`:**

| Screenshot | From | Filename |
|---|---|---|
| Permissions audit | Lab 01 | `cli-permissions-audit.png` |
| Archive investigation | Lab 02 | `cli-search-investigation.png` |
| VM configuration summary | Lab 03, Part A | `vm-config-summary.png` |
| VM dashboard, running + snapshot | Lab 03, Part C | `vm-dashboard-running.png` |

For each: on GitHub.com, navigate to `assets/screenshots/week-04/`, click **Add file → Upload files**, drag the image in (exact filenames above — lowercase, hyphens, no spaces), and **Commit changes**. Then open each uploaded image, right-click directly on it, choose **Copy image address** (Chrome/Edge) or **Copy Image Link** (Firefox), and paste the two VM links into the embeds below:

**If right-click doesn't show that option:** click the small download-arrow icon in the top-right of the image preview instead, then copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

**Commit message tip (from Lesson 4):** when GitHub asks for a commit message on your uploads, write one that says what the work is — *"Add Deliverable 1: VM lifecycle and CLI evidence"* — not "stuff." An employer reading your repo sees discipline in details like that.
